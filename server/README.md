### Key Points

- It seems likely that a RESTful API and database schema can be designed for a chat app with user accounts, friend-based chatting, and group rooms with invitations.
- Research suggests using JWT for authentication, WebSockets for real-time messaging, and SQLite for the database, given your tech stack (Hono + Bun, ReactJS).
- The evidence leans toward separating direct chats (between friends) and group chats (rooms with invitations) for clarity, with read/unread message tracking for both.

---

### RESTful API Endpoints

Here’s a suggested structure for your RESTful API endpoints, designed for ease of use with ReactJS:

- **User Management**: Register, login, logout, and update user details (e.g., `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/me`).
- **Friendship Management**: Send friend requests, accept/reject, and list friends (e.g., `/friend-requests`, `/friends`).
- **Direct Messaging**: Send and retrieve messages between friends, with read status (e.g., `/messages/direct`, `/messages/direct/{message_id}/read`).
- **Group Chat Management**: Create rooms, send messages, generate invitations, and join via links (e.g., `/rooms`, `/rooms/{room_id}/messages`, `/invitations/{token}/join`).
- **Real-Time Updates**: Use a WebSocket endpoint (`/ws`) for live message updates, authenticated with your JWT.

These endpoints should cover all features, with authentication ensuring secure access.

### Database Schema

Here’s a reliable SQLite schema to support your chat app, optimized for performance and scalability:

| Table Name       | Columns                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Users            | id, username, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at               |
| Friendships      | id, requester_id, requestee_id, status, created_at, updated_at           |
| Direct_Messages  | id, sender_id, receiver_id, content, is_read, created_at, updated_at     |
| Rooms            | id, name, creator_id, is_private, created_at, updated_at                 |
| Room_Members     | id, room_id, user_id, joined_at, is_admin                                |
| Group_Messages   | id, room_id, sender_id, content, created_at, updated_at                  |
| User_Room_Status | user_id, room_id, last_read_message_id, updated_at                       |
| Invitations      | id, room_id, token, created_by, created_at, expires_at, used_by, used_at |

This schema supports user accounts, friend relationships, direct chats, group rooms with invitations, and read/unread tracking for messages.

### Survey Note: Detailed Design for Chat Application API and Schema

This section provides a comprehensive analysis and design for creating a chat application with the specified features, using Hono + Bun with SQLite for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend. The design addresses user account creation, login/logout, friend-based one-on-one chatting, group chat rooms with invitation links, and read/unread message tracking. The following details are derived from best practices in RESTful API design and database schema optimization for chat applications, informed by recent resources and industry standards as of May 29, 2025.

#### Background and Requirements Analysis

The chat application requires the following features:

1. Users can create accounts, login, and logout, suggesting a need for robust authentication.
2. Users can chat with each other only after becoming friends, with friend addition facilitated by an ID code.
3. Users can create chat rooms (groups), and add participants via invitation links.
4. The application must support read and unread message tracking, crucial for user experience.

Given the tech stack (Hono + Bun with SQLite, ReactJS frontend), the design must leverage Bun's capabilities, including its support for WebSockets for real-time features, and ensure SQLite's lightweight nature is utilized effectively for the database.

#### Database Schema Design

The database schema is designed to support all features while maintaining simplicity and reliability. Below is a detailed breakdown, presented in a table for clarity:

| Table Name       | Description                                                                   | Columns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Users            | Stores user account information for authentication and identification.        | id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT), username (TEXT, UNIQUE, NOT NULL), email (TEXT, UNIQUE, NOT NULL), password_hash (TEXT, NOT NULL), created_at (DATETIME, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP), updated_at (DATETIME, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)                                                                                              |

| Rooms            | Represents group chat rooms, created by users, with privacy settings.         | id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT), name (TEXT, NOT NULL), creator_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to Users.id), is_private (BOOLEAN, DEFAULT TRUE), created_at (DATETIME, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP), updated_at (DATETIME, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)                                                                                       |
| Room_Members     | Tracks membership in rooms, including admin status for room management.       | id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT), room_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to Rooms.id), user_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to Users.id), joined_at (DATETIME, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP), is_admin (BOOLEAN, DEFAULT FALSE)                                                                                                                         |
| Group_Messages   | Stores messages sent within group chat rooms.                                 | id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT), room_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to Rooms.id), sender_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to Users.id), content (TEXT, NOT NULL), created_at (DATETIME, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP), updated_at (DATETIME, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)                                                                             |
| User_Room_Status | Tracks read status for group messages per user, using last read message ID.   | user_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to Users.id), room_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to Rooms.id), last_read_message_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to Group_Messages.id), updated_at (DATETIME, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)                                                                                                                                   |

This schema ensures:

- **Reliability**: Foreign key constraints maintain data integrity.
- **Scalability**: Tables are normalized to reduce redundancy, though SQLite's performance under high concurrency should be monitored.
- **Read/Unread Tracking**: Direct messages use an `is_read` field, while group messages use `User_Room_Status` for efficiency, avoiding excessive rows in a read receipts table.

#### RESTful API Endpoints

The RESTful API is designed to be intuitive for frontend consumption, with endpoints covering all required functionality. Below is a detailed list, organized by feature:

##### Authentication

- `POST /auth/register`: Register a new user with `{username, email, password}`. Returns user data and JWT token for authentication.
- `POST /auth/login`: Login with `{email, password}`. Returns user data and JWT token.
- `GET /auth/me`: Retrieve current user details, requiring `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- `PUT /auth/me`: Update user details (e.g., password), requiring authentication.

##### Friendship Management

- `POST /friend-requests`: Send a friend request with `{friend_id}`, requiring authentication. Ensures the target user exists.
- `GET /friend-requests/incoming`: List incoming friend requests for the current user.
- `GET /friend-requests/outgoing`: List outgoing friend requests sent by the current user.
- `PUT /friend-requests/{request_id}/accept`: Accept a friend request, updating status to 'accepted'.
- `PUT /friend-requests/{request_id}/reject`: Reject a friend request, updating status to 'rejected'.
- `GET /friends`: List all accepted friends of the current user, for direct chat eligibility.

##### Direct Messaging

- `GET /messages/direct?with={user_id}`: Retrieve direct messages with a specific user, ensuring they are friends. Supports pagination for large message histories.
- `POST /messages/direct`: Send a direct message with `{receiver_id, content}`, requiring friendship validation.
- `PUT /messages/direct/{message_id}/read`: Mark a direct message as read, only accessible by the receiver.

##### Group Chat Management

- `POST /rooms`: Create a new room with `{name, is_private}`, requiring authentication. Returns room details.
- `GET /rooms`: List all rooms the current user is a member of.
- `GET /rooms/{room_id}`: Retrieve details of a specific room, including members.
- `GET /rooms/{room_id}/messages`: Retrieve messages in a room, supporting pagination.
- `POST /rooms/{room_id}/messages`: Send a message to a room with `{content}`, requiring membership.
- `POST /rooms/{room_id}/invitations`: Generate an invitation token for the room, returning the token for sharing.
- `POST /invitations/{token}/join`: Join a room using an invitation token, requiring authentication. Updates `Invitations` table with `used_by` if valid.
- `PUT /rooms/{room_id}/read`: Update read status with `{last_message_id}`, setting `User_Room_Status` for the current user.

##### Real-Time Messaging with WebSockets

Given Bun's support for WebSockets, a real-time endpoint is recommended for live updates:

- `/ws`: WebSocket endpoint for real-time messaging. Clients connect with a query parameter `?token=<auth_token>` or via headers. Supports subscription to channels:
  - `{ "type": "subscribe", "target": "direct", "with": "user_id" }` for direct chats.
  - `{ "type": "subscribe", "target": "room", "room_id": "room_id" }` for group rooms.
  - The server pushes new messages to subscribed clients, ensuring low latency for chat updates.

This design leverages Bun's WebSocket capabilities, as detailed in [Bun WebSockets API](https://bun.sh/docs/api/websockets), for efficient real-time communication.

#### Implementation Considerations

- **Authentication**: JWT is recommended for token-based authentication, ensuring secure API access. The token should be included in the `Authorization` header for protected endpoints.
- **Real-Time Features**: While REST APIs are suitable for state changes, WebSockets are ideal for real-time messaging. Given Bun's support, as seen in [Building a Real-Time Chat App with Bun.js and WebSockets](https://medium.com/@aisyndromeart/building-a-real-time-chat-app-with-bun-js-and-websockets-a-step-by-step-guide-45c5018959f9), implement `/ws` for live updates, with polling as a fallback if WebSocket issues arise.
- **SQLite Performance**: SQLite is suitable for smaller to medium-sized applications but may face concurrency issues under high load. Consider implementing transaction management and monitoring for write bottlenecks, as discussed in [Simple Chat Application REST API](https://akiselev87.wordpress.com/2016/08/30/simple-chat-application-rest-api/).
- **Read/Unread Optimization**: For group chats, tracking `last_read_message_id` in `User_Room_Status` reduces database load compared to per-message read receipts, aligning with scalability insights from [How to Design a Real-Time Chat Application](https://algocademy.com/blog/how-to-design-a-real-time-chat-application-in-a-system-design-interview/).

#### Conclusion

This design provides a robust foundation for your chat application, balancing functionality with the constraints of your chosen tech stack. The RESTful API endpoints and database schema are tailored for ease of implementation and user experience, with WebSockets ensuring real-time communication. For further scalability, consider reviewing [Open Source REST API for Chat with Express, MongoDB, and Heroku](https://getstream.io/blog/rest-api-for-chat/) for insights into larger-scale chat systems, though adjustments would be needed for SQLite.
